# Recommend-System-R_programming
<p> Given that most predictors or recommend systems seldom take the security into consideration to help tourists to choose a house from Airbnb, we decided to mine the combined data of Airbnb and crime data in LA.
<p>** Objectives **
- Recommend visitors a good choice to stay from Airbnb in LA based on the price, number of people, score of housing and security level.
- Which affects the price/rating most?
Data source
Detailed listings data for Los Angeles:

Planned Data Mining Techniques
Use clustering techniques such as Kmeans to identify similar conditions of Airbnb housing
Use classification methods such as Decision Tree to identify factors most influencing the price and ratings
