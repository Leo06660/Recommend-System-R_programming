# Recommend-System-R_programming
<p> Given that most predictors or recommend systems seldom take the security into consideration to help tourists to choose a house from Airbnb, we decided to mine the combined data of Airbnb and crime data in LA.
<ul> Objectives 
  <li> Recommend visitors a good choice to stay from Airbnb in LA based on the price, number of people, score of housing and security level.
  <li> Which affects the price/rating most?
</ul>
<ul> Data source
 <li>Detailed listings data for Los Angeles: 
   http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
House listing dataset with 9 columns of information on 18,624 incidents
 <li>Detailed review data for listings in Los Angeles:

Crime dataset with 3 columns of information on 179,448 incidents
 <li>The crime data reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles:
